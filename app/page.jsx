          ETEC provides access to our remote help desk software for enhanced customer support. 
          Our help desk allows the Customer to open a service ticket for any questions or 
          issues related to their Kamstrup solution at any time. Once a service ticket is 
          created, our entire support team is notified, and a team member will respond to 
          answer questions or provide assistance to resolve any issues related to Kamstrupâ€™s 
          software, infrastructure, or devices.
